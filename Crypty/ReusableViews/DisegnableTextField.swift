    static let label = "Litecoin developement is open to the open source community. Protocol development is governed by a proposal process whereby anyone in the open source Litecoin community can submit Litecoin Improvement Proposals (\"LIPs\"). After debate by the community, the Litecoin Core editors, whom are supported by the Litecoin foundation, accept or reject the proposals. Decisions from the process are written into the Litecoin specification, as well as the software that runs the network. Finally, protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus. \n\nAlthough Litecoin Core and the Litecoin Foundation are separate, they work closely together on the Litecoin project with the Litecoin Foundation providing funding to Litecoin core developers.\n"
